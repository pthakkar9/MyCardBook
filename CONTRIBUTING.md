## üí≥ Adding New Credit Cards

### Card Data Format
We use a JSON database at `MyCardBook/Resources/CardDatabase/cards.json`. Here's the structure:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-card-id",
  "name": "Card Display Name",
  "issuer": "Bank Name", 
  "network": "visa|mastercard|amex|discover",
  "category": "personal|business",
  "color": "#HEX_COLOR",
  "credits": [
    {
      "id": "unique-credit-id",
      "title": "Credit Name",
      "description": "What the credit covers",
      "value": "$Amount",
      "frequency": "monthly|quarterly|annual",
      "category": "dining|travel|streaming|other"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Adding a New Card
1. **Research Thoroughly** - Verify all credit details from official sources
2. **Follow Naming Conventions** - Use official card names
3. **Include All Credits** - Only trackable credits (not cashback percentages)
4. **Test Locally** - Ensure the card loads properly in the app

### Example Card Addition
```json
{
  "id": "discover-it-cash-back",
  "name": "Discover it Cash Back",
  "issuer": "Discover",
  "network": "discover", 
  "category": "personal",
  "color": "#ff6600",
  "credits": []
}
```
