# MyCardBook - Product Vision Specification

*Version: 1.0*
*Last Updated: 2025-07-14*

## Mission Statement

**"Empowering credit card users to maximize their benefits and never let valuable credits expire."**

## Vision Statement

To become the leading iOS app that transforms how people think about and utilize their credit card benefits, making financial optimization accessible, simple, and rewarding for everyone. MyCardBook will be the go-to solution for credit card enthusiasts who value privacy, transparency, and community-driven development.

## Core Problem We Solve

Modern credit cards offer increasingly complex benefit structures with statement credits that renew monthly, quarterly, or annually. There are permanent or residual credits that are also available to use on many cards that are either not tracked or tracked poorly. Users struggle to:

1. **Track Multiple Credits**: Managing credits across multiple cards becomes overwhelming
2. **Manage Multiple Cards of the Same Type**: Managing multiple cards of the same type becomes overwhelming. There are users who have 2-3 cards of the same type (e.g. I have 2 Amex Personal Gold cards and 2 Amex Business Gold cards), and it's hard to keep track of them all.
3. **Avoid Expiration**: Valuable credits expire unused due to poor tracking
4. **Maximize Value**: Users miss opportunities to optimize their spending around available credits
5. **Stay Organized**: No centralized system exists for household credit management. There are users who want to track their own cards, but also want to track their spouse's cards in a household view that is easy and centralized to understand and use. 
6. **Open Source**: Users want to be able to see the complete code on GitHub with all the documentation and understand how the app works. This includes both the iOS app code and the card benefits database.

## Our Solution

MyCardBook - a simple, intuitive iOS app that:
- **Consolidates** all credit card benefits in one place
