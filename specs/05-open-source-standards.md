# MyCardBook - Open Source Standards Specification

*Version: 1.0*
*Last Updated: 2025-07-14*

## Overview

This specification defines the standards and practices for developing MyCardBook as a public domain, open source project. Every line of code, documentation, and architectural decision must be designed for transparency, community contribution, and public scrutiny.

## Core Open Source Principles

### 1. **Complete Transparency**
- **All code MUST be publicly visible** on GitHub from day one
- **All documentation MUST be comprehensive** and accessible to any developer
- **All architectural decisions MUST be documented** with clear rationale
- **All security practices MUST be transparent** and verifiable by the community

### 2. **Community-First Development**
- **Code MUST be written for community understanding** not just functionality
- **Documentation MUST assume zero prior knowledge** of the codebase
- **Architecture MUST be designed for community contribution** and review
- **All decisions MUST be documented** for future contributors

### 3. **Production-Grade Quality**
- **Code quality MUST meet enterprise standards** despite being open source
- **Security MUST be paramount** as the code will be publicly scrutinized
- **Performance MUST be optimized** for public benchmarking
- **Reliability MUST be bulletproof** as reputation depends on it

### 4. **Educational Value**
- **Code MUST serve as a learning resource** for other developers
- **Documentation MUST teach best practices** not just explain functionality
- **Architecture MUST demonstrate modern iOS development patterns**
- **Comments MUST explain "why" not just "what"**
