# Meta-Spec: How We Write Specifications

*Version: 1.0*
*Last Updated: 2025-07-13*

## Purpose

This document defines the philosophy, methodology, standards, process, principles, and structure for writing and maintaining specifications ("specs") in the MyCardBook project. It serves as the foundation for all other specifications and ensures consistency, clarity, and completeness across all documentation. It also serves as a reference for all contributors to ensure clarity, consistency, and quality in our planning and documentation.

## Why Have a Meta-Spec?
- **Consistency:** Ensures all specs follow a common structure and style
- **Clarity:** Makes it easy for anyone (including new contributors) to understand and use specs
- **Transparency:** Supports our open source values by making our process public
- **Maintainability:** Helps keep specs up-to-date and relevant

## Core Philosophy

### 1. **Specification-First Development**
- **Specifications MUST drive development** - not the other way around
- **All decisions MUST be documented** before implementation begins
- **Specifications MUST be living documents** that evolve with the product
- **Specifications MUST be the single source of truth** for all development decisions

### 2. **Clarity Over Brevity**
- **Specifications MUST be comprehensive** rather than concise
- **Ambiguity MUST be eliminated** through explicit requirements
- **Examples MUST be provided** for complex concepts
- **Context MUST be included** for all decisions and requirements

### 3. **Junior Developer Accessibility**
- **Specifications MUST be written for junior developers** with minimal prior knowledge
- **Technical jargon MUST be explained** or avoided
- **Assumptions MUST be explicitly stated** and justified
- **Learning resources MUST be referenced** for complex topics

### 4. **Open Source Transparency**
- **All specifications MUST be publicly accessible** and community-contributable
- **Decision rationale MUST be documented** for public scrutiny
- **Alternatives considered MUST be explained** with reasoning
- **Community feedback MUST be incorporated** into specifications
- **Specifications MUST be written in a way** that is easy to understand and follow
- **All code MUST be publicly accessible** and hence written in a way to meet or exceed the standards of the open source community and public scrutiny

## Spec Writing Principles
1. **Modularity:** Each spec should focus on a single topic or area
2. **Clarity:** Write for a junior developer or new contributor
3. **Completeness:** All requirements and context should be explicit
4. **Traceability:** Reference related specs where appropriate
5. **Versioning:** Include version and last updated date in each spec
6. **Open Review:** Specs are open to public review and improvement

## Specification Writing Methodology

### 1. **The Specification Lifecycle**

#### 1.1 Creation Phase
1. **Identify the Need**: What problem does this specification solve?
2. **Define Scope**: What is included and excluded?
3. **Research Existing Standards**: What best practices exist?
4. **Draft Initial Version**: Create comprehensive first draft
5. **Review and Refine**: Iterate based on feedback

#### 1.2 Maintenance Phase
1. **Regular Reviews**: Update specifications before each development phase
2. **Version Control**: Track changes and maintain history
3. **Cross-Reference Updates**: Ensure consistency across specifications
4. **Community Feedback**: Incorporate suggestions and improvements
5. **Validation**: Verify specifications against implementations

#### 1.3 Evolution Phase
1. **Gather Feedback**: Collect input from development and usage
2. **Identify Gaps**: Find areas needing clarification or expansion
3. **Update Requirements**: Reflect new insights and requirements
4. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure changes align with other specifications
5. **Document Changes**: Update version history and changelog

### 2. **Specification Structure Standards**

#### 2.1 Required Sections
Every specification MUST include:
- **Header**: Title, version, last updated date
- **Overview**: Purpose and scope of the specification
- **Core Principles**: Fundamental values and approach
- **Detailed Requirements**: Comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements
- **Success Metrics**: How success will be measured
- **Related Specifications**: Cross-references to other specs
- **Version History**: Track of changes and updates

#### 2.2 Optional Sections
Specifications MAY include:
- **Background**: Context and history
- **Examples**: Concrete examples and use cases
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
- **FAQ**: Frequently asked questions
- **Glossary**: Definitions of terms and concepts

### 3. **Writing Standards**

#### 3.1 Language and Tone
- **Use "MUST" for requirements** - not "should" or "may"
- **Use present tense** for current requirements
- **Use future tense** for planned features
- **Maintain professional but accessible tone**
- **Avoid jargon** unless absolutely necessary
- **Define all acronyms** and technical terms

#### 3.2 Formatting Standards
- **Use Markdown** for all specifications
- **Use consistent heading hierarchy** (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
- **Use bullet points** for lists and requirements
- **Use code blocks** for examples and technical content
- **Use tables** for structured data and comparisons
- **Use links** for cross-references and external resources

#### 3.3 Requirement Formatting
```
- **REQ-ID**: Requirement description in clear, actionable language
- **Rationale**: Why this requirement exists (if not obvious)
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How to verify the requirement is met
- **Dependencies**: Other requirements or systems this depends on
```

## Spec Structure
Each spec should include:
- **Title** (with version and last updated date)
- **Overview/Purpose**
- **Detailed Content** (requirements, flows, diagrams, etc.)
- **Cross-References** to other specs
- **Change Log** (optional, for major specs)
